<!---Welcome! This repository contains the code for the backend of Addike-CT, a Challenge Tester written in Golang! --->

### üèÅ Introduction

Addike-CT is an efficient, and user-friendly program tester, implemented in Golang and Svelte. When it is run, it compares the stdout of programs in the working directory against the required stdout in a secure manner. It also implements a clean ui, in the browser, so you can easily track the progress of your testing!

### ‚õèÔ∏è Download & Install
